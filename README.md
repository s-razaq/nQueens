# nQueens

Using a regular chess board, the challenge is to place N queens on the board such that no queen is attacking any of the others.

## What is the problem?

 It requires an understanding of recursion in algorithm design and can be quite useful as an exercise in learning to program solutions for complex problems. This problem was proposed by Max Bezzel in 1848 and solved by Franz Nauck in 1850. The problem is simple. It starts with a chess board and eight queens, then set up the board so that no two queens can attack each other. There is more than one solution, and your job is to find them all. We already know that there are 92 possible solutions. And we already have examples of the solutions in several computer languages.

If you've never played chess, you'll need to understand that a queen can attack by moving an unlimited number of spaces in three directions. Horizontally, vertically and diagonally. This means that no two queens can share a row or column, nor can they be located diagonally from each other. In the following video I'll show you my solution to the eight queens problem. I'd encourage you to also look at the solutions from other authors in the lynda.com library. You'll be able to compare different author styles and different languages.
