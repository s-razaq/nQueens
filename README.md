# nQueens

Using a regular chess board, the challenge is to place N queens on the board such that no queen is attacking any of the others.

## What is the problem?

This problem was proposed by Max Bezzel in 1848 and solved by Franz Nauck in 1850. The problem is simple. It starts with a chess board and eight queens, then set up the board so that no two queens can attack each other. There is more than one solution, and your job is to find them all. We already know that there are 92 possible solutions. 

If you've never played chess, you'll need to understand that a queen can attack by moving an unlimited number of spaces in three directions. Horizontally, vertically and diagonally. This means that no two queens can share a row or column, nor can they be located diagonally from each other.
